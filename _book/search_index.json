[["geodemographics.html", "1 Geodemographics 1.1 Reading list 1.2 Geodemographics", " 1 Geodemographics This week we will see how we can use socio-demographic and socio-economic data to characterise neighbourhoods using geodemographics. Geodemographics is the “analysis of people by where they live’ (Harris et al. 2005) and as such entails representing the individual and collective identities that are manifest in observable neighbourhood structure” (Longley 2012). We will look at geodemographics by focusing on a existing geodemographic classification known as the Internet User Classification. 1.1 Reading list Essential readings Longley, P. A. 2012.

[Link] 1.2 Geodemographics The CDRC Internet User Classification (IUC) is a bespoke geodemographic classification that describes how people residing in different parts of Great Britain interact with the Internet. For every Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) in England and Wales and Data Zone (DZ) (2011 Census Geographies), the IUC provides aggregate population estimates of Internet use (Singleton et al. 2020) and provides insights into the geography of the digital divide in the United Kingdom. “Digital inequality is observable where access to online resources and those opportunities that these create are non-egalitarian. As a result of variable rates of access and use of the Internet between social and spatial groups (..), this leads to digital differentiation, which entrenches difference and reciprocates digital inequality over time (Singleton et al. 2020).” 1.2.1 Internet User Classification I For the first part of this week’s practical material, we will be looking at the Internet User Classification (IUC) for Great Britain in more detail by mapping it. Our first step is to download the IUC data set: Open a web browser and go to the data portal of the CDRC. Register if you need to, or if you are already registered, make sure you are logged in. Search for Internet User Classification. Scroll down and choose the download option for the IUC 2018 (CSV). Save the iuc_gb_2018.csv file in an appropriate folder. Figure 1.1: Download the GB IUC 2018. Start by inspecting the data set in MS Excel, or any other spreadsheet software such as Apache OpenOffice Calc or Numbers. Also, have a look at the IUC 2018 User Guide that provides the pen portraits of every cluster, including plots of cluster centres and a brief summary of the methodology. Note It is always a good idea to inspect your data prior to analysis to find out how your data look like. Of course, depending on the type of data, you can choose any tool you like to do this inspection (ArcGIS, R, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, etc.).

As the IUC is created at the level of the Lower layer Super Output Area Census geography, we need to download its administrative borders. As the data set for the entire country is quite large, we will focus on Liverpool. Go to the UK Data Service Census support portal and select Boundary Data Selector. Set Country to England, Geography to Statistical Building Block, dates to 2011 and later, and click Find. Select English Lower Layer Super Output Areas, 2011 and click List Areas. Select Liverpool from the list and click Extract Boundary Data. Wait until loaded and download the BoundaryData.zip file. Unzip and save the file in the usual fashion. Note You could also have downloaded the shapefile with the data already joined to the LSOA boundaries directly from the CDRC data portal, but this is the national data set and is quite large (75MB). Also, as we will be looking at Liverpool today we do not need all LSOAs in Great Britain. Of course, you could have used this file and filtered out all LSOAs that fall within the boundaries of Liverpool. Now we got the administrative boundary data, we can prepare the IUC map by joining our csv file with the IUC classification to the shapefile. # load libraries library(sf) library(tmap) # load spatial data liverpool &lt;- st_read(&quot;data/boundaries/england_lsoa_2011.shp&quot;) ## Reading layer `england_lsoa_2011&#39; from data source ## `/Users/justinvandijk/Dropbox/UCL/Web/jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0114/data/boundaries/england_lsoa_2011.shp&#39; ## using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 298 features and 3 fields ## Geometry type: POLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 332390.2 ymin: 379748.5 xmax: 345636 ymax: 397980.1 ## Projected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid # inspect plot(liverpool$geometry) # join data liv_iuc &lt;- left_join(liverpool, iuc, by = c(code = &quot;LSOA11_CD&quot;)) # inspect liv_iuc ## Simple feature collection with 298 features and 7 fields ## Geometry type: POLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 332390.2 ymin: 379748.5 xmax: 345636 ymax: 397980.1 ## Projected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid ## First 10 features: ## label name code SHP_ID LSOA11_NM ## 1 E08000012E02006934E01033755 Liverpool 062D E01033755 25097 Liverpool 062D ## 2 E08000012E02006932E01033758 Liverpool 060B E01033758 24070 Liverpool 060B ## 3 E08000012E02001356E01033759 Liverpool 010F E01033759 26845 Liverpool 010F ## 4 E08000012E02006932E01033762 Liverpool 060E E01033762 26866 Liverpool 060E ## 5 E08000012E02001396E01032505 Liverpool 050F E01032505 27848 Liverpool 050F ## 6 E08000012E02001396E01032506 Liverpool 050G E01032506 2429 Liverpool 050G ## 7 E08000012E02001396E01032507 Liverpool 050H E01032507 24242 Liverpool 050H ## 8 E08000012E02001373E01032508 Liverpool 027G E01032508 28413 Liverpool 027G ## 9 E08000012E02001373E01032509 Liverpool 027H E01032509 24339 Liverpool 027H ## 10 E08000012E02001354E01032510 Liverpool 008F E01032510 25167 Liverpool 008F ## GRP_CD GRP_LABEL geometry ## 1 2 e-Professionals POLYGON ((334276.7 391012.8... ## 2 4 Youthful Urban Fringe POLYGON ((335723 391178, 33... ## 3 7 Passive and Uncommitted Users POLYGON ((338925 394476, 33... ## 4 1 e-Cultural Creators POLYGON ((334612.4 391111.7... ## 5 7 Passive and Uncommitted Users POLYGON ((335894.7 387448.3... ## 6 6 e-Mainstream POLYGON ((336256.7 387691.8... ## 7 3 e-Veterans POLYGON ((336803.5 387432.7... ## 8 10 e-Withdrawn POLYGON ((339299 391470, 33... ## 9 7 Passive and Uncommitted Users POLYGON ((338901 391308, 33... ## 10 7 Passive and Uncommitted Users POLYGON ((338018.2 395716.4... # inspect tmap_mode(&quot;view&quot;) tm_shape(liv_iuc) + tm_fill(col = &quot;GRP_LABEL&quot;) + tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE) Let’s use the same colours as used on CDRC mapmaker by specifying the hex colour codes for each of our groups.

Try using the Mid-Year Population Estimates 2019 that you can download below to: calculate the total number of people associated with each cluster group for England and Wales as a whole (not just Liverpool!); and create a pretty data visualisation showing the results (no map!).

K-means clustering aims to partition a set of observations into a number of clusters (k), in which each observation will be assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean. As such, a cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities (i.e. standardised scores of your input data). In order to run a k-means clustering, you first define a target number k of clusters that you want. The k-means algorithm subsequently assigns every observation to one of the clusters by finding the solution that minimises the total within-cluster variance. For the second part of this week’s practical material, we will be replicating part of the Internet User Classification for Great Britain. For this we will be using an MSOA-level input data set containing various socio-demographic and socio-economic variables that you can download below together with the MSOA administrative boundaries. The data set contains the following variables: Variable Definition msoa11cd MSOA Code age_total, age0to4pc, age5to14pc, age16to24pc, age25to44pc, age45to64pc, age75pluspc Percentage of people in various age groups nssec_total, 1_higher_managerial, 2_lower_managerial, 3_intermediate_occupations, 4_employers_small_org, 5_lower_supervisory, 6_semi_routine, 7_routine, 8_unemployed Percentage of people in selected operational categories and sub-categories classes drawn from the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) avg_dwn_speed, avb_superfast, no_decent_bband, bband_speed_under2mbs, bband_speed_under10mbs, bband_speed_over30mbs Measures of broadband use and internet availability File download File Type Link MSOA-level input variables for IUC csv Download Middle-layer Super Output Areas Great Britain 2011 shp Download # load data iuc_input &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/index/msoa_iuc_input.csv&quot;) # inspect head(iuc_input) ## # A tibble: 6 × 23 ## msoa11cd age_total age0to4pc age5to…¹ age16…² age25…³ age45…⁴ age75…⁵ nssec…⁶ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 E02000001 7375 0.032 0.0388 0.0961 0.407 0.273 0.0607 5816 ## 2 E02000002 6775 0.0927 0.122 0.113 0.280 0.186 0.0980 3926 ## 3 E02000003 10045 0.0829 0.102 0.118 0.306 0.225 0.0646 6483 ## 4 E02000004 6182 0.0590 0.102 0.139 0.254 0.250 0.0886 4041 ## 5 E02000005 8562 0.0930 0.119 0.119 0.299 0.214 0.0501 5368 ## 6 E02000007 8791 0.103 0.125 0.129 0.285 0.197 0.0688 5158 ## # … with 14 more variables: `1_higher_managerial` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `2_lower_managerial` &lt;dbl&gt;, `3_intermediate_occupations` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `4_employers_small_org` &lt;dbl&gt;, `5_lower_supervisory` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `6_semi_routine` &lt;dbl&gt;, `7_routine` &lt;dbl&gt;, `8_unemployed` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # avg_dwn_speed &lt;dbl&gt;, avb_superfast &lt;dbl&gt;, no_decent_bband &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # bband_speed_under2mbs &lt;dbl&gt;, bband_speed_under10mbs &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # bband_speed_over30mbs &lt;dbl&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​age5to14pc, … "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
