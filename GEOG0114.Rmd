# Geodemographics
This week we will see how we can use socio-demographic and socio-economic data to characterise neighbourhoods using **geodemographics**. Geodemographics is the "*analysis of people by where they liveâ€™ (Harris et al. 2005) and as such entails representing the individual and collective identities that are manifest in observable neighbourhood structure*" ([Longley 2012](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13658816.2012.719623?needAccess=true)). We will look at geodemographics by focusing on a existing geodemographic classification known as the [Internet User Classification](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/internet-user-classification).

## Geodemographics
The [CDRC Internet User Classification](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/internet-user-classification) (IUC) is a bespoke geodemographic classification that describes how people residing in different parts of Great Britain interact with the Internet. For every Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) in England and Wales and Data Zone (DZ) ([2011 Census Geographies](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography)), the IUC provides aggregate population estimates of Internet use ([Singleton *et al.* 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971519307963)) and provides insights into the geography of the digital divide in the United Kingdom. 

> "Digital inequality is observable where access to online resources and those opportunities that these create are non-egalitarian. As a result of variable rates of access and use of the Internet between social and spatial groups (..), this leads to digital differentiation, which entrenches difference and reciprocates digital inequality over time ([Singleton *et al.* 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971519307963))."

### Internet User Classification I
For the first part of this week's practical material, we will be looking at the Internet User Classification (IUC) for Great Britain in more detail by mapping it.

Our first step is to download the IUC data set:

- Open a web browser and go to the [data portal of the CDRC](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk).
- Register if you need to, or if you are already registered, make sure you are logged in.
- Search for **Internet User Classification**.
- Scroll down and choose the download option for the *IUC 2018 (CSV)*.
- Save the `iuc_gb_2018.csv` file in an appropriate folder.

```{r iuc-download, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Download the GB IUC 2018.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/w07/iuc_download.png')
```

Start by inspecting the data set in MS Excel, or any other spreadsheet software such as [Apache OpenOffice Calc](https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html) or [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/uk/numbers/). Also, have a look at the [IUC 2018 User Guide](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/system/files/iuc2018userguide.pdf) that provides the **pen portraits** of every cluster, including plots of cluster centres and a brief summary of the methodology.

<div class="note">
**Note**<br/>
It is always a good idea to inspect your data prior to analysis to find out how your data look like. Of course, depending on the type of data, you can choose any tool you like to do this inspection ([ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/), [Microsoft Excel](https://www.office.com/), etc.).
</div>

```{r iuc-in-excel, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='GB IUC 2018 in Excel.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/w07/iuc_excel.png')
```

```{r 07-load-libraries-and-data, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)

# load data
iuc <- read_csv('data/index/iuc_gb_2018.csv')

# inspect
iuc

# inspect data types
str(iuc)
```

Now the data are loaded we can move to acquiring our spatial data. As the IUC is created at the level of the Lower layer Super Output Area [Census geography](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography), we need to download its administrative borders. As the data set for the entire country is quite large, we will focus on [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool).

1. Go to the [UK Data Service Census support portal](https://borders.ukdataservice.ac.uk/) and select **Boundary Data Selector**.
2. Set Country to *England*, Geography to *Statistical Building Block*, dates to *2011 and later*, and click **Find**.
3. Select *English Lower Layer Super Output Areas, 2011* and click **List Areas**.
4. Select *Liverpool* from the list and click **Extract Boundary Data**.
5. Wait until loaded and download the `BoundaryData.zip` file.
6. Unzip and save the file.

<div class="note">
**Note**<br/>
You could also have downloaded the shapefile with the data already joined to the LSOA boundaries directly from the CDRC data portal, but this is the national data set and is quite large (75MB). Also, as we will be looking at [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool) today we do not need all LSOAs in Great Britain..
</div>

Now we got the administrative boundary data, we can prepare the IUC map by joining our `csv` file with the IUC classification to the `shapefile`.

```{r 07-load-those-spatial-data, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# load libraries
library(sf)
library(tmap)

# load spatial data
liverpool <- st_read('data/boundaries/england_lsoa_2011.shp')

# inspect
plot(liverpool$geometry)

# join data
liv_iuc <- left_join(liverpool, iuc, by = c('code' = 'LSOA11_CD'))

# inspect
liv_iuc

# inspect
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(liv_iuc) +
  tm_fill(col='GRP_LABEL') +
  tm_layout(legend.outside=TRUE)
```

Let's use the same colours as used on [CDRC mapmaker](https://mapmaker.cdrc.ac.uk/#/internet-user-classification?lon=-2.81187&lat=53.31045&zoom=9.58) by specifying the **hex** colour codes for each of our groups. Note the order of the colours is important: the colour for group 1 is first, group 2 second and so on. 

```{r 07-pretty-colours, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# define palette
iuc_colours <- c('#dd7cdc','#ea4d78','#d2d1ab','#f36d5a','#a5cfbc','#e4a5d0','#8470ff','#79cdcd','#808fee','#ffd39b')

# plot pretty
tm_shape(liv_iuc) +
  tm_fill(col='GRP_LABEL', palette=iuc_colours) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside=TRUE)
```

### Tutorial task I {#task_w07_1}
Now we have these cluster classifications, how can we link them to people? Try using the **Mid-Year Population Estimates 2019** that you can download below to:

- calculate the total number of people associated with each cluster group **for England and Wales as a whole** (not just Liverpool!); and
- create a pretty data visualisation showing the results (no map!).

### k-means clustering
In several cases, including the [2011 residential-based area classifications](http://josis.org/index.php/josis/article/view/232/150) and the Internet User Classification, a technique called **k-means clustering** is used in the creation of a geodemographic classification. K-means clustering aims to partition a set of observations into a number of clusters (*k*), in which each observation will be assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean. As such, a cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities (i.e. standardised scores of your input data). In order to run a **k-means clustering**, you first define a target number *k* of clusters that you want. The k-means algorithm subsequently assigns every observation to one of the clusters by finding the solution that minimises the total within-cluster variance. For the second part of this week's practical material, we will be replicating part of the Internet User Classification for Great Britain. For this we will be using an MSOA-level input data set containing various socio-demographic and socio-economic variables that you can download below together with the MSOA administrative boundaries.

The data set contains the following variables:

| Variable  | Definition |
|---|---|
| `msoa11cd` | MSOA Code |
| `age_total`, `age0to4pc`, `age5to14pc`, `age16to24pc`, `age25to44pc`, `age45to64pc`, `age75pluspc`| Percentage of people in various age groups |
| `nssec_total`, `1_higher_managerial`, `2_lower_managerial`, `3_intermediate_occupations`, `4_employers_small_org`, `5_lower_supervisory`, `6_semi_routine`, `7_routine`, `8_unemployed` | Percentage of people in selected operational categories and sub-categories classes drawn from the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification ([NS-SEC](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/otherclassifications/thenationalstatisticssocioeconomicclassificationnssecrebasedonsoc2010)) |
| `avg_dwn_speed`, `avb_superfast`, `no_decent_bband`, `bband_speed_under2mbs`, `bband_speed_under10mbs`, `bband_speed_over30mbs` | Measures of broadband use and internet availability |

```{r 07-load-date-for-those-mean-ks, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# load data
iuc_input <- read_csv('data/index/msoa_iuc_input.csv')

# inspect
head(iuc_input)
```

Before running our **k-means** clustering algorithm, we need to extract the data which we want to use; i.e. we need to remove all the columns with data that we do not want to include in the clustering process.

```{r 07-select-the-columns, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# column names
names(iuc_input)

# extract columns by index
cluster_data <- iuc_input[,c(3:8,10:17,18:20)]

# inspect
head(cluster_data)
```

We also need to rescale the data so all input data are presented on a comparable scale: the average download speed data (i.e. `avg_dwn_speed`) is very different to the other data that, for instance, represent the percentage of the population by different age groups.

```{r 07-rescale-those-values, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# rescale
cluster_data <- scale(cluster_data) 

# inspect
head(cluster_data)
```

Now our data are all on the same scale, we will start by creating an elbow plot. The [elbow method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering)#:~:text=In%20cluster%20analysis%2C%20the%20elbow,number%20of%20clusters%20to%20use%60) is a visual aid that can help in determining the number of clusters in a data set. Remember: this is important because with a **k-means** clustering you need to specify the numbers of clusters *a priori*! 

The elbow method can help as it plots the total explained variation ('Within Sum of Squares') in your data as a function of the number of cluster. The idea is that you pick the number of clusters at the 'elbow' of the curve as this is the point in which the additional variation that would be explained by an additional cluster is decreasing. Effectively this means you are actually running the **k-means** clustering multiple times before running the actual **k-means** clustering algorithm.

```{r 07-settings-and-options, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# settings
options(max.print = 15)
```
```{r 07-elbow-and-plots, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE,tidy=TRUE}
# create empty list to store the within sum of square values 
wss_values <- list()

# execute a k-means clustering for k=1, k=2, ..., k=15
for (i in 1:15) {
  wss_values[i] <- sum(kmeans(cluster_data,centers=i,iter.max=30)$withinss)
}

# inspect
wss_values

# vector to dataframe
wss_values <- as.data.frame(wss_values)

# transpose
wss_values <- as.data.frame(t(wss_values))

# add cluster numbers
wss_values$cluster <- seq.int(nrow(wss_values))
names(wss_values) <- c('wss','cluster')

# plot using ggplot2
ggplot(data=wss_values, aes(x=cluster,y=wss)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,15)) +
  xlab('number of clusters') +
  ylab('within sum of squares')
```

Based on the elbow plot, we can now choose the number of clusters and it looks like **7** clusters would be a reasonable choice.

<div class="note">
**Note**<br/>
The interpretation of an elbow plot can be quite subjective and often multiple options would be justified: **6**, **8**, and perhaps **9** clusters also do not look unreasonable. You would need to try the different options and see what output you get to determine the 'optimal' solution. However, at very least, the elbow plot does give you an idea of what would potentially be an adequate number of clusters. 
</div>

Now we have decided on the number of clusters (i.e. **7** clusters), we can run our cluster analysis. We will be running this analysis 10 times because there is an element of randomness within the clustering, and we want to make sure we get the optimal clustering output.

```{r 07-run-that-cluster, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# create empty list to store the results of the clustering
clusters <- list()

# create empty variable to store fit
fit <- NA
  
# run the k-means 10 times
for (i in 1:10){
  
  # keep track of the runs
  print(paste0('starting run: ', i))
  
  # run the k-means clustering algorithm to extract 7 clusters
  clust7 <- kmeans(x=cluster_data, centers=7, iter.max=1000000, nstart=1)
  
  # get the total within sum of squares for the run and 
  fit[i] <- clust7$tot.withinss
  
  # update the results of the clustering if the total within sum of squares for the run
  # is lower than any of the runs that have been executed so far 
  if (fit[i] < min(fit[1:(i-1)])){
    clusters <- clust7}
}

# inspect
clusters

# inspect
fit
```

We now have to execute a bit of post-processing to extract some useful summary data for each cluster: the cluster size (`size`) and mean values for each cluster.

```{r 07-post-process-some-cluster-stuff, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# assign to new variable for clarity
kfit <- clusters

# cluster sizes
kfit_size <- kfit$size

# inspect
kfit_size

# mean values for each variable in each cluster
kfit_mean<- as_tibble(aggregate(cluster_data,by=list(kfit$cluster),FUN=mean))
names(kfit_mean)[1] <- 'cluster'

# inspect
kfit_mean

# transform shape to tidy format
kfit_mean_long <- pivot_longer(kfit_mean, cols=(-cluster))

# plot using ggplot2  
ggplot(kfit_mean_long, aes(x=cluster, y=value, colour=name)) + 
  geom_line () +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,7,by=1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

Looking at the table with the mean values for each cluster and the graph, we can see, for instance, that only **cluster 2** shows a clear pattern with Internet usage. *Your values may be slightly different because there is this element of randomness within the clustering.* The graph is a little busy, so you might want to look at the cluster groups or variables individually to get a better picture of each cluster. 

```{r 07-map-our-iuc, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# read shape
msoa <- st_read('data/boundaries/gb_msoa11_sim.shp')

# set projection
st_crs(msoa) = 27700

# simplify for speedier plotting
msoa <- st_simplify(msoa, dTolerance = 100) 

# join
cluster_data <- cbind(iuc_input,kfit$cluster)
msoa <- left_join(msoa,cluster_data,by=c('geo_code'='msoa11cd'))

# plot
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(msoa) +
  tm_fill(col='kfit$cluster')
```

### Tutorial task II {#task_w07_2}
The creation of a geodemographic classification is an **iterative process** of trial and error that involves the addition and removal of variables as well as experimentation with different numbers of clusters. It also might be, for instances, that some clusters are very focused on one group of data (e.g. age) and it could be an idea to group some ages together. If you want to make changes to the clustering solution, you can simply re-run the analysis with a different set of variables or with a different number of clusters by updating the code. However, it would be even simpler if you could automate some of the process. 

Try to create a **R function** that: 

1. takes *at least* the following three arguments: **a data frame that contains your input data**, **the number of clusters that you want**, and **a list of input variables**;
2. executes a **k-means** clustering on the input variables and the specified number of clusters; and,
3. produces a `csv` file that contains the **table of means** of the solution.

#### Tips {-}
1. The list of input variables does not have to be a list of *names*, but can also be a list containing the index values of the columns.
2. Google is your friend.
3. Your function should look something like: `automate_k_means(dataframe,number_of_clusters,input_variables)`
4. Feel free to add optional variables that you need to specify if that makes it easier.
5. Have a look at [Hadley Wickhams explanation of functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) in R.

## Before you leave {#byl-w07}
Having finished this tutorial, you should now understand the basics of a geodemographic classification. In addition, you should have written a simple function. Although [you have now reached the end of this week's content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iwBM_YB1sE), you could try and improve your function. Consider:

1. Including *maps* or *graphs* in the code that get automatically saved.
2. Ensuring that the `csv` outcome does **not** get overwritten every time you run you function.
3. Including optional arguments in your function with **default values** if certain values are not specified.

# Transport Network Analysis
This week we will cover a different type of data: network data. We will take a look at how we can use network data to measure accessibility using the `dodgr` R library. We will calculate the network distances between combinations of locations (i.e. a set of origins and a set of destinations). These distances can then, for instance, be used to calculate the number of a resource (e.g. fast-food outlets) within a certain distance of a Point of Interest (e.g. a school or population-weighted centroid).

## Transport Network Analysis 
The term network analysis covers a wide range of analysis techniques ranging from complex network analysis to social network analysis, and from link analysis to transport network analysis. What the techniques have in common is that they are based on the concept of a **network**. A network or network graph is constituted by a collection of vertices that are connected to one another by edges. Note, vertices may also be called nodes or points, whilst edges may be called links or lines. Within social network analysis, you may find the terms actors (the vertices) and ties or relations (the edges) also used. 

```{r network-graph-picca, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Visualising networks with vertices and edges.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/w08/network-graph.png")
```

Understanding that networks are formed through the connections of vertices and edges, we can think of many naturally and manmade occurring networks that also have a precise geography to them (i.e. their distribution can be mapped directly within geographic space), such as rivers connected with tributaries, animal tracks, electricity pylons and cables, and our road and street networks that form crucial parts of our infrastructure. The latter, in particular, have been a substantial focus of those working within spatial analysis over the last two decades, particularly with routing applications now dominating much of our day-to-day technology, from personal route-planning and ride-share apps to large-scale logistics and infrastructure applications, including the delivery operations behind all of our online shopping and even [Scotland's Trunk Road Gritters](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2de764a9303848ffb9a4cac0bd0b1aab).

Alongside this development of routing applications, GIS analysts, geographers and public health specialists have also identified the utility of network analysis within geographic space to calculate distance-based measurement and coverage buffers that can be used as part of accessibility studies that look to understand the provision of a specific resource (e.g. greenspaces, hospitals, and fast-food stores) to a certain area of population.

### Accessibility in Portsmouth
For this week's practical, we will be using Portsmouth in the UK as our area of interest for our analysis. One prominent topic within the city is the issue of public health and childhood obesity. According to figures released in March 2020 by Public Health England, more than one in three school pupils are overweight or obese by the time they finish primary school within the city - higher than the national average of one in four. One potential contributor to the health crisis is the ease and availability of fast-food outlets in the city. In the following, we will measure the accessibility of fast-food outlets within specific walking distances of all school in Portsmouth starting at 400m, then 800m and finally a 1km walking distance. We will then aggregate these results to the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) and overlay these results with some socio-economic variable.

To execute this analysis, we will need to first calculate the distances between our schools and fast-food outlets. This involves calculating the shortest distance a child would walk between a school and a fast-food outlet, using roads or streets. We will use the `dodgr` R package to conduct this transport network analysis.

:::note
**Note**<br/>
All calculations within the `dodgr` library currently need to be run in WGS84/4236. This is why we will not transform the CRS of our data in this practical.

### Acquiring network data {#loading-data-w08}
The first dataset we need to download will help with the visualisation of our results: boundary data that contains an outline of Portsmouth.

| File                                    | File Type         | Link |
| :------                                     | :------      | :------ |
| Major towns and cities boundaries 2015      | `shp`        | [Download](https://github.com/jtvandijk/GEOG0114/tree/master/data/zip/major_towns.zip) |

We can now load the required libraries as well as the major towns and cities boundaries `shapefile`.

```{r load-ports, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(osmdata)
library(dodgr)

# load major towns and cities, filter Portsmouth
portsmouth_city <- st_read("data/outline/Major_Towns_and_Cities__December_2015__Boundaries.shp", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% filter(tcity15nm == "Portsmouth")
```

To create our network and Origin-Destination dataset, we will need data on schools, fast-food outlets, and a streetnetwork. Today we will be using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) for this. If you have never come across OpenStreetMap (OSM) before, it is a free editable map of the world. 

:::note
**Note** <br />
Note
OpenStreetMapâ€™s spatial coverage is still unequal across the world - plus, as you will find if you use the data, the accuracy and quality of the data can often be quite questionable or simply missing attribute details that we would like to have, e.g. types of roads and their speed limits, to complete specific types of spatial analysis. As a result, do not expect OSM to contain every piece of spatial data that you would want.
:::

Whilst there are [various approaches](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Downloading_data) to downloading data from OpenStreetMap, we will use the `osmdata` library to directly extract our required OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into a variable. The `osmdata` library grants access within R to the [Overpass API](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) that allows us to run queries on OSM data and then import the data as spatial objects. These queries are at the heart of these data downloads.

We will go ahead and start with downloading and extracting our road network data. To OSM data using the `osmdata` library, we can use the `add_osm_feature()` function. To use the function, we need to provided it with either a *bounding box* of our area of interest (AOI) or a set of points, from which the function will create its own bounding box. You can find out more about this and details on how to construct your own queries in the [data vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmdata/vignettes/osmdata.html).

To use the library (and API), we need to know how to write and run a query, which requires identifying the `key` and `value` that we need within our query to select the correct data. Essentially every map element (whether a point, line or polygon) in OSM is **tagged** with different attribute data. These `keys` and `values` are used in our queries to extract only map elements of that feature type - to find out how a feature is tagged in OSM is simply a case of [reading through the OSM documentation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags) and becoming familiar with their keys and values.

To download our road network dataset, we first define a variable to store our bounding box coordinates, `p_bbox()`. We then use this within our OSM query to extract specific types of road segments within that bounding box - the results of our query are then stored in an `osmdata` object. We will select all OSM features with the `highway` tag that are likely to be used by pedestrians (e.g. not `motorways`).

```{r download_osm, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# define our bbox coordinates for Portsmouth
p_bbox <- c(-1.113197,50.775781,-1.026508,50.859941)

# pass bounding box coordinates into the OverPassQuery (opq) function
# only download features that are not classified as motorway
osmdata <- opq(bbox = p_bbox ) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway", value = c("primary", "secondary", "tertiary", "residential", "path", "footway", "unclassified", "living_street", "pedestrian")) %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
```

:::note
**Note** <br />
In some instances the OSM query will return an error, especially when several people from the same location are executing the exact same query. If this happens, you can just read through the instructions and download a prepared copy of the data that contains **all** required OSM Portsmouth data instead: [[Link]](https://github.com/jtvandijk/GEOG0114/tree/master/data/zip/osm_portmouth.zip).
:::

The `osmdata` object contains the bounding box of your query, a time-stamp of the query, and then the spatial data as `osm_points`, `osm_lines`, `osm_multilines` and `osm_polgyons` (which are listed with their respective fields also detailed). Some of the spatial features maybe empty, depending on what you asked your query to return. Our next step therefore is to extract our spatial data from our `osmdata` object to create our road network data set. This is in fact incredibly easy, using the traditional `$` R approach to access these spatial features from our object. 

Deciding what to extract is probably the more complicated aspect of this - mainly as you need to understand how to represent your road network, and this will usually be determined by the library/functions you will be using it within. Today, we want to extract the **edges** of the network, i.e. the lines that represent the roads, as well as the **nodes** of the network, i.e. the points that represent the locations at which the roads start, end, or intersect. For our points, we will only keep the `osm_id` data field, just in case we need to refer to this later. For our lines, we will keep a little more information that we might want to use within our transport network analysis, including the type of road, the maximum speed, and whether the road is one-way or not. 

```{r roadnetwork, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# extract the points, with their osm_id.
ports_roads_nodes <- osmdata$osm_points[, "osm_id"]

# extract the lines, with their osm_id, name, type of highway, max speed and oneway attributes 
ports_roads_edges <- osmdata$osm_lines[, c("osm_id", "name", "highway", "maxspeed", "oneway")]
```

To check our data set, we can quickly plot the edges of our road network using the `plot()` function:

```{r networkplot, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
plot(ports_roads_edges, max.plot=1)
```

Because we are focusing on walking, we will overwrite the `oneway` variable by suggesting that none of the road segments are restricted to one-way traffic which may affect our analysis as well as the general connectivity of the network.

```{r roadnetwork-no-oneway, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# overwrite one-way default
ports_roads_edges$oneway <- "no"
```

Now we have the network edges, we can turn this into a graph-representation that allows for the calculation of network-based accessibility statistics. 

### Measuring accessibility
Before we can construct our full network graph for the purpose of accessibility analysis, we need to also provide our **Origin** and **Destination** points, i.e. the data points we wish to calculate the distances between. According to the `dodgr` documentation, these points need to be in either a vector or matrix format, containing the two coordinates for each point for the origins and for the destinations.

As for our Portsmouth scenario we are interested in calculating the shortest distances between schools and fast-food outlets, we need to try and download these datasets - again we will turn to OpenStreetMap. Following a similar structure to our query above, we will use our knowledge of OpenStreetMap `keys` and `values` to extract the points of Origins (schools) and Destinations (fast-food outlets) we are interested in:

```{r schools_ff_osm, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# download schools from OSM
schools <- opq(bbox = p_bbox) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = 'amenity', value = 'school') %>% 
  osmdata_sf()

# download fast-food outlets 
ff_outlets <- opq(bbox = p_bbox) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = 'amenity', value = 'fast_food') %>%
  osmdata_sf()
```

We also need to then extract the relevant data from the `osmdata` object:

```{r schools_ff_points, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# extract school points
ports_schools <- schools$osm_points[ , c("osm_id", "name")]

# extract fast-food outlet points
ports_ff <- ff_outlets$osm_points[ , c("osm_id", "name")]
```

We now have our road network data and our Origin-Destination (OD) points in place and we can now move to construct our network graph and run our transport network analysis.

:::note
**Note** <br />
In this analysis, we are highly reliant on the use of OpenStreetMap to provide data for both our Origins and Destinations. Whilst in the UK OSM provides substantial coverage, its quality is not always guaranteed. As a result, to improve on our current methodology in future analysis, we should investigate into a more official school data set or at least validate the number of schools against City Council records. The same applies to our fast-food outlets.
:::

With any network analysis, the main data structure is a **graph**, constructed by our nodes and edges. To create a graph for use within `dodgr`, we pass our `ports_roads_edges()` into the `weight_streetnet()` function. The `dodgr` library also contains weighting profiles, that you can customise, for use within your network analysis. These weighting profiles contain weights based on the type of road, determined by the type of transportation the profile aims to model. Here we will use the weighting profile **foot**, as we are looking to model walking accessibility.

```{r network_graph, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# create network graph  with the foot weighting profile
graph <- weight_streetnet(ports_roads_edges, wt_profile = "foot")
```

Once we have our graph, we can then use this to calculate our network distances between our OD points. One thing to keep in mind is that potentially not all individual components in the network that we extracted are connected, for instance, because the bounding box cut off the access road of a [cul-de-sac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_end_(street)). To make sure that our entire extracted network is connected, we now extract the **largest connected component** of the graph. You can use `table(graph$component)` to examine the sizes of all individual subgraphs. You will notice that most subgraphs consist of a very small number of edges.

:::note
**Note** <br />
The `dodgr` package documentation explains that components are numbered in order of decreasing size, with `$component = 1` always denoting the largest component. Always inspect the resulting subgraph to make sure that its coverage is adequate for analysis.
:::

```{r network_graph_extract, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# extract the largest connected graph component
graph_connected <- graph[graph$component == 1, ]

# inspect number of remaining road segments
nrow(graph_connected)

# inspect on a plot
plot(dodgr_to_sf(graph_connected), max.plot=1)
```

:::note
**Note** <br/>
OpenStreetMap is a living dataset, meaning that changes are made on a continuous basis; as such it may very well possible that the number of remaining road segments as shown above may be slighlty different when you run this analysis. 
:::

Now we have our connected subgraph, will can use the `dodgr_distances()` function to calculate the network distances between every possible Origin and Destination. In the `dodgr_distances()` function, we first pass our `graph`, then our Origin points (schools), in the `from` argument, and then our Destination points (fast-food outlets), in the `to` argument. One thing to note is our addition of the `st_coordinates()` function as we pass our two point data sets within the `from` and `to` functions as we need to supplement our Origins and Destinations in a matrix format. For all Origins and Destinations, `dodgr_distances()` will map the points to the **closest network points**, and return corresponding shortest-path distances. 

```{r distance_calc, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# create a distance matrix between schools and fast-food stores
sch_to_ff_calc <- dodgr_distances(graph_connected, from=st_coordinates(ports_schools), to= st_coordinates(ports_ff), shortest = TRUE, pairwise = FALSE, quiet=FALSE)
```

The result of this computation is a distance-matrix that contains the network distances between all Origins (i.e. schools) and all Destinations (i.e. fast-food outlets). Let's inspect the first row of our output. Do you understand what the values mean?

```{r data_check, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# inspect
head(sch_to_ff_calc, n=1)
```

Our output shows the calculations for the first school - and the distances between the school and every fast-food outlet. Because we manually overwrote the values for all one-way streets as well as that we extracted the larges connected graph only, we currently should not have any `NA` values.

:::note
**Note** <br/>
The [`dodgr` vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dodgr/vignettes/dodgr.html#4_Distance_Matrices:_dodgr_dists()) notes that
a distance matrix obtained from running `dodgr_distances` on `graph_connected` should generally contain no `NA` values, although some points may still be effectively unreachable due to one-way connections (or streets). Thus, routing on the largest connected component of a directed graph ought to be expected to yield the minimal number of `NA` values, which may sometimes be more than zero. Note further that spatial routing points (expressed as from and/or to arguments) will in this case be mapped to the nearest vertices of `graph_connected`, rather than the potentially closer nearest points of the full graph.
:::

The next step of processing all depends on what you are trying to assess - here we want to understand which schools have a higher accessibility of fast-food outlets compared to others, quantified by how many outlets are within walking distance of specific distances. We will therefore look to count how many outlets are with walking distance from each school and store this as a new column within our `ports_school` data frame. 

```{r count_aggregation, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# fastfood outlets within 400m
ports_schools$ff_within_400m <- rowSums(sch_to_ff_calc <= 400)

# fastfood outlets within 800m
ports_schools$ff_within_800m <- rowSums(sch_to_ff_calc <= 800)

# fastfood outlets within 1000m
ports_schools$ff_within_1km <- rowSums(sch_to_ff_calc <= 1000)
```

We can then look at our outputs quickly again using the `plot()` function.

```{r schools_plot, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# set CRS for Portsmouth schools
ports_schools <- st_set_crs(ports_schools, 4326)

# plot results
plot(ports_schools)
```

Just from this simple plot, we can see across our distances some clear geographical patterns in accessibility of fast-food outlets for schools. We can improve this plot by making a proportional symbols map that show the different counts of fast-food outlets for each school in Portsmouth with a background of the Portsmouth City outline that you loaded at the beginning of this practical.

```{r 07-bubble-maps, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
# create proportional symbol map
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(portsmouth_city) + 
  tm_fill(palette = "grey") +
tm_shape(ports_schools) + 
  tm_bubbles(size = "ff_within_400m", col = "skyblue4", 
             style = "pretty", scale = 1, border.col = "white", 
             title.size = "Total Count") +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "top"), legend.text.size = 1,
            main.title = "Fast-food outlets within 400m of a school", 
            main.title.size = 1) + 
  tm_compass(type = "arrow", position = c("right", "top")) + 
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("left", "bottom")) +
  tm_credits("Â© OpenStreetMap contributors")
```

The map shows that areas with greater access/exposure to fast-food outlets (denoted by the larger symbols) appear to be within the city centre and in the south, whereas those schools in the north have less exposure. However, with additional contextual information one would also be able to see that these two areas correlate quite well with the more commercial areas within Portsmouth, the high street and an area known as Gunwharf Quays. This suggests there are complexities in understanding accessibility as well as trying to apply specific policies such as banning new fast-food takeaways within a 400m range of school, particularly if these schools are in commercial areas.

### Tutorial task {#task-w08}
Now you have calculated the number of fast-food outlets within specific distances from every school in Portsmouth, your task is to estimate the accessibility of fast-food outlets at the LSOA scale and compare this to the [2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019). 

:::note
**Note** <br/>
This skills and steps required for this analysis are not just based on this week's practical, but you will have to combine all your knowledge of coding and spatial analysis you have gained over the past weeks.
:::

One way of doing this, is by taking some of the following steps:

1. Download and extract the 2011 LSOA boundaries of Portsmouth.
2. Download the [2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) scores.
3. Decide on an accessibility measure, such as:
    + The average number of fast-food restaurants within `x` meters of a school within each LSOA.
    + The average distance a fast-food restaurant is from a school within each LSOA.
    + The (average) shortest distance a fast-food restaurant is from a school within each LSOA.
    + The minimum shortest distance a fast-food outlet is from a school within each LSOA.
4. Create a choropleth map of aggregate accessibility to visualise the results.
5. Join the 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation data to your LSOA dataset.
6. For each IMD decile, calculate the average for your chosen aggregate measure and produce a table. 

Using your approach what do you think: are fast-food restaurants, on average, more accessible for students at schools that are located within LSOAs with a lower IMD decile when compared to students at schools that are located within LSOAs with a higher IMD decile?

## Before you leave {#byl-w08}
Having finished this tutorial on transport network analysis and, hopefully, having been able to independently conduct some further area-profiling using IMD deciles, [you have now reached the end of this week's content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFw7q-BLxLA). However, there is some additional fundamental challenges to  consider in the context of transport network and accessibility analysis:

1. How do the different weight profiles of the `dodgr` package work? How would one go about creating your own weight profile? How would using a different weight profiles affect the results of your analysis?
2. Why do we have unconnected segments in the extracted transport network? How would you inspect these unconnected segments? Would they need to be connected? If so, how would one do this?
3. Why you think all Origins and Destinations are mapped onto the closest network points? Is this always the best option? What alternative methods could you think of and how would you implement these?
