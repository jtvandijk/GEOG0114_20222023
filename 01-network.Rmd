# Transport Network Analysis
This week we will cover a different type of data: network data. We will take a look at different types of network analysis and how they apply to different applications and can be used within spatial analysis. For our practical component, we will look at current some approaches to analyse road networks in R using the `dodgr` library to calculate the network distance between two points (i.e. an origin and a destination). These distances can then be used to calculate the number of a resource (e.g. fast-food outlets) within a certain distance of a POI, e.g. a school or population-weighted centroid.

## Network Analysis 
The term network analysis covers a wide range of analysis techniques, from complex network analysis, social network analysis, link analysis, as well as road network analysis. A network or network graph is constituted by a collection of vertices that are connected to one another by edges. Note, vertices may also be called nodes or points, whilst edges may be called links or lines. Within social network analysis, you may find the terms actors (the vertices) and ties or relations (the edges) also used. 

```{r 07-network-graph, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Visualising networks through vertices and edges.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/w07/network-graph.png')
```

Understanding that networks are formed through the connections of vertices and edges, we can think of many naturally and manmade occurring networks that also have a precise geography to them (i.e. their distribution can be mapped directly within geographic space), including rivers connected with tributaries and animal tracks, to electricity pylons and cables and our road and street networks that form crucial parts of our infrastructure. 

The latter, in particular, have been a substantial focus of those working within spatial analysis over the last two decades, particularly with routing applications now dominating much of our day-to-day technology, from personal route-planning and ride-share apps to large-scale logistics and infrastructure applications, including the delivery operations behind all of our online shopping and even [Scotland's Trunk Road Gritters](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2de764a9303848ffb9a4cac0bd0b1aab).

Alongside this development of routing applications, GIS analysts, geographers and public health specialists have also identified the utility of network analysis within geographic space to calculate distance-based measurement and coverage buffers that can be used as part of accessibility studies that look to understand the provision of a specific resource (e.g. greenspaces, hospitals or even fast-food stores) to a certain area of population.

### Accessibility to fast-food outlets
For this week's practical, we will be using Portsmouth in the UK as our area of interest for our analysis. One prominent topic within the city is the issue of public health and childhood obesity. According to figures released in March 2020 by Public Health England, more than one in three school pupils are overweight or obese by the time they finish primary school within the city - higher than the national average of one in four. One potential contributor to the health crisis is the ease and availability of fastfood in the city. We will measure accessibility by understanding how many fast-food outlets are within specific walking distances of each school, starting at 400m, then 800m and finally a 1km walking distance. We will then aggregate these counts at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) and compare these results across the city.

To get this data ready for our spatial and socio-economic analyses, we will need to first calculate the distances between our schools and fast-food outlets. This involves calculating the shortest distance a child would walk between a school and a fast-food outlet, using roads or streets. We will use the `dodgr` package to conduct a road network analysis between each school and fast-food outlet.

**Note**<br/>
All calculations within the `dodgr` library currently need to be run in WGS84/4236. This is why we will not transform the CRS of our data in this practical.

### Loading data {#loading-data-w07}
The first dataset we need to download will help with the visualisation of our results: boundary data that contains an outline of Portsmouth.

| File                                    | File Type         | Link |
| :------                                     | :------      | :------ |
| Major towns and cities boundaries 2015      | `shp`        | [Download](https://github.com/jtvandijk/GEOG0114/tree/master/data/zip/major_towns.zip) |

We can now load the required libraries as well as the major towns and cities boundaries `shapefile`.

```{r load-ports, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
#library(tmap)
library(osmdata)
library(dodgr)

# load major towns and cities, filter Portsmouth
portsmouth_city <- st_read("data/outline/Major_Towns_and_Cities__December_2015__Boundaries.shp", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% filter(tcity15nm == "Portsmouth")
```
