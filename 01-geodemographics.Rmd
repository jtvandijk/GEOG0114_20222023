# Geodemographics
This week we will see how we can use socio-demographic and socio-economic data to characterise neighbourhoods using **geodemographics**. Geodemographics is the *analysis of people by where they liveâ€™ (Harris et al. 2005) and as such entails representing the individual and collective identities that are manifest in observable neighbourhood structure* ([Longley 2012](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13658816.2012.719623?needAccess=true)). We will look at geodemographics by focusing on a existing geodemographic classification known as the [Internet User Classification](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/internet-user-classification).
